# TransmissionSankey
Look at flows of where infections come from and go to, cross-referencing EMOD log files.
Python script "parse_transmission_sankey.py" should be renamed to "dtk_post_process.py" and run server-side.
Plotting scripts should be run locally after obtaining minimized tables from post-processing.
